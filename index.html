    <h4 align="center" class="sub-title">Is it true that climate change impacting Australia?</h4><br><br>
    <strong>Climate change</strong> is has been a buzzword for quite a some time now. Renowned celebrities and politicians have been making headlines everywhere around the world and asking governments to take counter measures before it's too late. Australian celebrities have been putting their fare share too. From Radio host Ryan Fitzgerald, Singer Julia Stone to actors like Russel Crowe, Cate Blanchett. This is even when climate is more or less similar in Australia for almost a decade. I mean c'mon- Bushfires and Heatwaves are not new to athe Land down under. Scorching heat has always been doing it during the summers. How does it matter all of a sudden now? Is it some kind of conspiracy to divert government fund towards something as fake as big foot? 
<br><br>Well... 
let's see.
<br><br>
Answer to this question lies in asking yourself another important question- isn't showing proactiveness at work life and personal life always has helped us? Or do we wait deadline to cross first then submit the proposal? Of course not, we would not risk any risk of losing potential or present customers. Then why are we risking losing the our life and future generations of this Earth. This is the only home we have.
<br>
<br>
And no, it is not a conspiracy. We are taking efforts but apparently they are not enough. Earth's temperature has always been fluctuating by small margin. But for the first time

*The above line graph shows how the anomaly in mean temperature of Australia has been varying from 1910 to 2019. It is only the human interference which has causes mean temperature anomaly to vary beyond 1 degree celsius. Such variation are harmful, earth is getting warmer by year and faster than we knew. This causes unpredictable weather conditions.
<br><br>

Until recently reason climate change effects have not been so prominently seen, is because these changes have been very slow. And god forbid the day will come when bad effects will show prominently across globe. BecauseÂ  that day will be too late to take countermeasures. Taken countermeasures will take another 4-5 years at minimum to show its effect and we cannot imagine what havoc and loss could take place in between those years. Earth's climate has been degrading slowly and effects are slow. This is primarily because climate of Earth is dependent on numerous factors right from salt water currents, ice caps on north and south pole to the tilted axis of earth and its exposure to sun in different stages of Solar cycle. Human interference has impacted air, soil and water, these things in turn affect the Earth's ecosystem.
